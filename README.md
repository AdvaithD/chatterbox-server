#chatterbox-server
This assignment constitutes part II of a multi-part sprint exploring client-server architecture. In part I, I built the chatterbox client-side app, and configured it to communicate with a remote Parse server. In this part, we replace the Parse server with a local Node.js server.

Users are able to connect to your Node server with a web browser, choose a username, send messages, and see the messages sent by all the other users connected to the same server.

We also deloyed the app on Heroku.

#Installation
```sh
npm install --save underscore
npm install
```

To run the tests, ```npm test``` from the main directory.

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
